All the downloaded materials  were unzipped into  the folder \"**/Documentation/data/NLSY97_Religiosity_20042014**\", located in the GitHub Repository. \n(The naming convention is \"Study_Focus_DDMMYYYofDownload\")   \n\n#### The files include:    \nNLSY97_Religiosity_20042014.cdb - **codebook** containing item descriptions  \nNLSY97_Religiosity_20042014.csv - **data** in comma delimited format  \nNLSY97_Religiosity_20042014.NLSY97 - **tagset**, the list of variables in the downloaded dataset  \nNLSY97_Religiosity_20042014.dtc - STATAÂ® **dictionary** file of selected variables, contains data as well\n  \n\nAfter importing the data from the datafile,\n<!-- run initial import from the databank defined by tagset. --> \n```{r LoadData, echo=echoChunks, message=FALSE, results=\"hide\"}\n```\nwe have created the initial wide dataset with\n```{r,echo=TRUE}\n# dsSource  - cointains all imported variables\nlength(unique(dsSource$id)) \n```\nindividuals. Of them,\n``` {r, echo=TRUE}\n# 1 - Cross-sectional\n# 0 - Oversample\ntable(dsSource$sample)\n\n```\n\n``` {r, echo=TRUE}\n# dsSourceLabels - contains the RNUM (NLSY97 Variables codes) and VARIABLE_TITLE used by NLY Investigator \nprint(dsSourceLabels) \n\n```\n\nTo explore the variables in the native context of NLS, go to [NLS Investigator](https://www.nlsinfo.org/investigator/pages/login.jsp), select \"NLYS97 1997-2011\" in the first dropdown box and then click on \"Choose File\" under \"Upload Tagset.\" Select the file \"NLSY97_Religiosity_20042014.NLSY97\" from the folder \"**/Documentation/data/NLSY97_Religiosity_20042014**\", in the GitHub repository.\n\n## Variables by Occasions\nTo better understand the longitudinal structure of the selected variables, the dataset was re-arranged in the two-dimensional slice of Cattell's databox: variables by occasions.\n## Figure 1\n<img link src=\"./figure_rmd/variables_layout.png\" alt=\"Databox slice\" style=\"width:800px;\"/>  \n[Interactive version](\"./www/slice-vo.html\")\n\nThis databox slice indicates in what year measurement was taken for selected variables  and describes the variables extracted from NLYS97 for analysis. Three descriptions are given:  \n**Variable Title**, which is verbatim identifier from NLSY97,  \n**Unit**, which attemps to give a brief desription of the scale on which the variable is measured, and  \n**Codename**, which spells the name of the variable, as it is used in R code that services the analysis\n\nThe excel spreadsheet (*NLYS97_Religiosity_20042014.xlsx*) in the \"./Documentation/data\" folder, hosts this list, as well as a semi-automated routine (Tab \"Renaming\") to aid in renaming the repeated endings in the variable names for easier coding. The values in the \"Variable Title\" can be used to locate the item in the [NLS Investigator](https://www.nlsinfo.org/investigator/pages/login.jsp) by copy/pasting it into \"Word in Title\" search line\n## Figure 2\n<img src=\"./figure_rmd/nls_investigator_snapshot.png\" alt=\"Looking up items\" style=\"width:800px ;\"/>\n\nAfter renaming, we arrive at the basic clean dataset in wide format.\n```{r TweakData, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, results=\"hold\"}\n#dsSource\nprint(dsLong[dsLong$id==1,])\n```\n\n\n\n",
