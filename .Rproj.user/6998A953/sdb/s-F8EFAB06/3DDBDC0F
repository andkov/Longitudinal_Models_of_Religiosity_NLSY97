NSLY97 contains static and dynamic indicators of age age. Variables byear and bmonth were recorded once in 1997 (static) and contain respondentsâ€™ birth year and birth month respectively. Two age variables were recorded continuously at each interview (dynamic): age at the time of the interview in months agemon and in years ageyear. Next graph shows how births in the NLSY97 sample (static age) was distributed over calendric months from 1980 to 1984:\n\nMonths of births\n----------------\n\n    Source: local data frame [13 x 4]\n    Groups: bmonth\n\n       bmonth byearF count  born\n    1       1   1980   159  80-1\n    2       2   1980   136  80-2\n    3       3   1980   139  80-3\n    4       4   1980   125  80-4\n    5       5   1980   128  80-5\n    6       6   1980   137  80-6\n    7       7   1980   136  80-7\n    8       8   1980   141  80-8\n    9       9   1980   144  80-9\n    10     10   1980   146 80-10\n    11     11   1980   146 80-11\n    12     12   1980   154 80-12\n    13      1   1981   160  81-1\n\n![plot of chunk bmonth\\_dist](figure_rmd/Descriptives/bmonth_dist.png)\n\nAge and cohort structure\n------------------------\n\n![plot of chunk agemon\\_dist](figure_rmd/Descriptives/agemon_dist.png)\n\n=== Read more in <code>./Models/Descriptives</code>:\n+ [Descriptives](./Descriptives.md) - basic stats of various items\n+ [Attendance](./Attendance.md) - focus on church attendence over time\n+ [Metrics](./Metrics.md) - how values of items are labeled\n+ [Databox](./Databox.md)\n",
