Description of the scripts used in model sequencing
===  
  
**singleModel_brief.R** - conducts the analysis for a single model. Looped.

**sequenceLCM.R** - combines the graphs for each model into a report of model sequence  

**LCModels2.R** - specifies estimation formulas for each model in the sequence


**FERE graph.R** - estimation of the Fixed Effects (FE) and Random Effects (RE) are printed into a table.

**bar graph of fit.R** - skyscraper graph of Deviance, AIC, and BIC

**line graph of trajectories.R** - modeled trajectories are graphed
