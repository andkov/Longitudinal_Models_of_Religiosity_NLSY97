## Age-Period-Cohort Structure

NLSY97 sample includes individuals from five cohorts, born between 1980 and 1984.The following graphics shows how birth cohort, age of respondents, and round of observation are related in NSLY97.

There are several indicators of age in NSLY97 that vary in precision. Birth cohort is the most general one, it was recorded once. Two variables were recorded at each interview: age at the time of the interview in months (**agemon**) and years (**ageyear**). Those are not derivatives of each other, but, understandably, are closely related. The variable **ageyear** records the full number of years a respondent reached at the time of the interview. Due to difficulties of administering the survey, time intervals between the waves could differ. 

```{r}
dsLCM<-dsL[dsL$year %in% c(2000:2011),c('id',"byear","year","attend","ageyear","agemon")]
ds<- dsLCM[dsLCM$id %in% c(25),]
ds$age<-ds$year-ds$byear
ds$ageALT<- ds$agemon/12
print(ds)
```

For example, for one person **id**=25 the age was recorded as 21 years for both 2003 and 2004 (see **ageyear**). However, when you examine age in months (**agemon**) you can see this is rounding issue that disappears once a more precise scale is used. To avoid this potentially confusing peculiarity, age in years will be either calculated as computed as (**age** = **year** - **byear**) or as (**ageALT** = **agemon**/12).
