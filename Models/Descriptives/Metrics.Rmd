Metrics: labeling factors and exploring scales
==============================================
Report explains how the response categories from NLSY97 questionnaire are labeled and demonstrates application of labeled factors in data operations and graphing.

```{r DeclareGlobals, echo=echoChunks, message=FALSE}
# attcol8 - attANDANCE colOUR 8 categories - set up default colors for "attend"
```

```{r LoadPackages, echo=echoChunks, message=F}
```

```{r LoadData, echo=echoChunks, message=T}
# select only respondence in the cross-sectional sample

```


## Data In
Initial point of departure - the [databox][1] of the selected sample, described in the [Methods][2] chapter.
<img link src="./figure_rmd/3_Methods_Figure_3_2.png" alt="Databox slice" style="width:900px;"/>
This [databox][1] corresponds to the dataset **dsL** produced by [Derive_dsL_from_Extract][3] report. 
```{r echo=T, message=T}
dsL<-readRDS("./Data/Derived/dsL.rds")
dsL<- dsL[dsL$sample==1,] # cross-sample only
```
<img link src="./figure_rmd/3_Methods_Figure_3_3.png" alt="View of dsL" style="width:900px;"/>

##  Labeling Factor Levels
Review of the item reference [cards][1] shows that initially, all items were recorded on some discrete scale, either counting occasions or assigning an intiger to a category of response. However, data were saved as numerical values or  intigers
```{r}
ds<- dsL[,1:(ncol(dsL)/2)]# selects the first half of variables
str(ds)
```
[LabelingFactorLevels.R][4] sourced at the end of [Derive_dsL_from_Extract][3] matches numeric values with response labels from the questionnaire and adds to **dsL** copies of the variables, saved as labeled factors. For estimations routines such as lm4 or graphing  functions such as ggplot, the  data type (string,numeric,  factor) is a meaningful input, so a quick access to both formats frequently proves useful.  It is convenient to think that **dsL** has really only
```{r}
ncol(dsL)/2
```
variables, but each of them has a double, a labeled factor.
```{r}
str(dsL)
```
This give a certain flexibiity to assemble needed dataset quickly and have access to factor labels. One can alternate between the raw metric and labeled factor by adding "F" suffix to the end of the variable name:
```{r}
selectCols<-c("year","id","byear","attend","attendF") # select the columns with these names
ds<-dsL[,selectCols] # select all rows for the columns listed  selectCols
print(ds[ds$id==1,]) # print all availible data for respondent with ID 1
```
Having quick access to factor labels will be especially useful during graph production.

## Time metrics : Age, Period, Cohort
NLSY97 sample includes individuals from five cohorts, born between 1980 and 1984.The following graphics shows how birth cohort, age of respondents, and round of observation are related in NSLY97.
<img src="./figure_rmd/3_Methods_Figure_3_1.png" alt="Age, Peridod, Cohort" style="width:700px ;"/>

There are several indicators of age in NSLY97 that vary in precision. Birth cohort (**byear**) is the most general one, it was recorded once. Two age variables were recorded at each interview: age at the time of the interview in months (**agemon**) and in years (**ageyear**). Those are not derivatives of each other, but are are closely related. The variable **ageyear** records the full number of years a respondent reached at the time of the interview. Due to difficulties of administering the survey, time intervals between the waves could differ. 
For example, for one person **id** = 25 the age was recorded as 21 years for both 2003 and 2004 (see **ageyear**). However, when you examine age in months (**agemon**) you can see this  rounding issue  disappears once a more precise scale is used. To avoid this potentially confusing peculiarity, age in years will be  calculated as (**age** = **year** - **byear**) or as (**ageALT** = **agemon**/12).
```{r}
ds<-dsL[dsL$year %in% c(2000:2011),c('id',"byear","year","attend","ageyear","agemon")]
ds<- ds[ds$id %in% c(25),]
ds$age<-ds$year-ds$byear
ds$ageALT<- ds$agemon/12
print(ds)
```

## Mapping Church Attendance

The focal variable of interest is **attend**, an item measuring church attendance in the current year. The questionnaire recorded the responses on the ordinal scale.   
```{r attend_2000, echo=echoChunks, message=T, out.width="700px", fig.width = 8}
p<-ggplot(subset(dsL,year==2000), aes(x=attendF, fill=attendF ))
p<- p+geom_bar(color="black")
p<- p+scale_fill_manual(values=attcol8, na.value="white")
p<- p+coord_flip()
p<- p+xlab("Church attendance") 
p<- p+ylab("Count")
p<- p+labs(title="How often did you attend a place of worship in the last year? (2000)")
p
```

Creating frequency distributions for each of the measurement wave we have:  
```{r attend_2000_2011,echo=echoChunks, message=F, out.width="700px", fig.width = 8 }
# attcol8 is defined in DeclareGlobal chunk of  the .R file
ds<- dsL
p<-ggplot(ds, aes(x=yearF, fill=attendF))
p<-p+ geom_bar(position="fill")
p<-p+ scale_fill_manual(values = attcol8,
                    name="Response category" )
p<-p+ scale_y_continuous("Prevalence: proportion of total",
                     limits=c(0, 1),
                     breaks=c(.1,.2,.3,.4,.5,.6,.7,.8,.9,1))
p<-p+ scale_x_discrete("Waves of measurement",
                   limits=as.character(c(2000:2011)))
p<-p+ labs(title=paste0("In the past year, how often have you attended a worship service?"))
p
```

Missing values are used in the calculation of total responses to show the natural attrition in the study. 
Assumming that attrition is not significantly associated with  the outcome measure, we can remove missing values from the calculation of the total of responses and  look at percentages that each response was endorsed at each time point. 
```{r attend_2000_2011_na,echo=T, message=F, out.width="700px", fig.width = 8 }
ds<- dsL
p<-ggplot(subset(ds, !is.na(attendF)), aes(x=yearF, fill=attendF))
p<-p+ geom_bar(position="fill")
p<-p+ scale_fill_manual(values = attcol8,
                    name="Response category" )
p<-p+ scale_y_continuous("Prevalence: proportion of total",
                     limits=c(0, 1),
                     breaks=c(.1,.2,.3,.4,.5,.6,.7,.8,.9,1))
p<-p+ scale_x_discrete("Waves of measurement",
                   limits=as.character(c(2000:2011)))
p<-p+ labs(title=paste0("In the past year, how often have you attended a worship service?"))
p
```

Graphs above shows change in the cross-sectional distribution of responses over the years. Modeling the change in these response frequencies is handled well by Markov  models.  LCM, however, works with longitudinal data, modeling the trajectory of each individual and treating attendance as a continuous outcome.

To demonstrate mapping of individual trajectories to time, let's select a  dataset that would include personal identifyer (**id**), cohort indicator (**byear**), wave of measurement (**year**) and the focal variable of interest - worship attendance (**attend**). 
```{r, echo=T, message=F, warning=warningChunks}
ds<-dsL[dsL$year %in% c(2000:2011),c('id',"byear","year","attend","attendF")] # select needed variables
print(ds[ds$id==47,])# for a single subject with id=47
```

The view above lists attendance data for subjust with id = 47. Mapping his attendance to time we have 
```{r,echo=echoChunks, message=F, out.width="700px", fig.width = 8, warning=warningChunks }
ds<-dsL[dsL$year %in% c(2000:2011),c('idF',"byear","year","attend","attendF")] # select needed variables
ds<- ds[ds$id==47,]
p<-ggplot(ds, aes(x=year,y=attend, color=idF))
p<-p+ geom_line(color="purple")
# p<-p+ geom_smooth(method=lm)
p<-p+ geom_point(color="purple")
p<-p+ scale_y_continuous("Church attendance",
                     limits=c(1, 8),
                     breaks=c(1:8))
p<-p+ scale_x_continuous("Waves of measurement",
                   limits=c(2000,2011),
                   breaks=c(2000:2011))
p<-p+ labs(title=paste0("In the past year, how often have you attended a worship service?"))
p
```  

where vertical dimension maps the outcome value and the horizontal maps the time. There will be a trajecory for each of the 
```{r, echo=T, message=F, warning=warningChunks}
cat(length(unique(dsL$id)))
```
subjects in total. Unless specified otherwise, only individuals from the cross-sample will be used in the model to increase external validity.
```{r}
ds<- dsL[dsL$sample==1,]
```


Each of such trajectories imply a story, a life scenario. Why one person grows in his religious involvement, while other declines, or never develops an interest in the first place? To demostrate how interpretations of trajectories can vary among individuals consider the following scenario.

Attendance trajectories of subjects with **id**s  4, 25, 35, and 47 are plotted in the next graph

```{r,echo=echoChunks, message=F, out.width="700px", fig.width = 8 }

ds<- dsL[dsL$id %in% c(4, 25, 35, 47),]
p<-ggplot(ds, aes(x=year,y=attend, color=idF))
p<-p+ geom_line()
# p<-p+ geom_smooth(method=lm)
p<-p+ geom_point()
p<-p+ scale_y_continuous("Church attendance",
                     limits=c(1, 8),
                     breaks=c(1:8))
p<-p+ scale_x_continuous("Waves of measurement",
                   limits=c(2000,2011),
                   breaks=c(2000:2011))
p<-p+ labs(title=paste0("In the past year, how often have you attended a worship service?"))
p
```

The respondent  **id**=35 reported attending no worship services in any of the years, while respodent **id**=25 seemed to frequent it, indicating weekly attendance in 8 out of the 12 years. Individual **id**=47 started as a fairly regular attendee of religious services in 2000 (5= "about twice a month"), then gradually declined his involvement to nill in 2009 and on. Respondent **id**=4, on the other hand started off with a rather passive involvement, reporting  attended church only "Once or twice"  in 2000,  maintained a low level of participation throughout the years, only to surge his attendance in 2011.  Latent curve models will describe intraindividual trajectories of change, while summarizinig the interindividual similarities and trends.  

Previous research in religiousity indicated that age might be one of the primary factors explaining interindividual differences in church attendance. To examine the role of age, we change the metric of time from waves of measurement, as in the previous graph, to biological age.

```{r,echo=echoChunks, message=F, out.width="700px", fig.width = 8 }

ds<- dsL[dsL$id %in% c(4, 25, 35, 47),]
p<-ggplot(ds, aes(x=ageyear,y=as.numeric(attend), color=idF ))
p<-p+ geom_line()
# p<-p+ geom_smooth(method=lm)
p<-p+ geom_point()
p<-p+ scale_y_continuous("Church attendance",
                     limits=c(1, 8),
                     breaks=c(1:8))
p<-p+ scale_x_continuous("Age in years",
                   limits=c(16,31),
                   breaks=seq(from=12, to=31,by=1))
p<-p+ labs(title=paste0("In the past year, how often have you attended a worship service?"))
p
```

Persons **id** = 35 and **id** = 25 are peers, in 2000 they were both 17.  Respondent **id** = 47 is a year older, in 2000 he was 18. The oldest is **id** = 4, who by the last round of measurement in 2011 is 30 years of age. Perhaps, his increased church attendance could be explained by starting a family of his own?

Note that for person **id** = 25 the age was recorded as 21 years for both 2003 and 2004. However, when you examine age in months (**agemon**) you can see this is rounding issue that disappears once a more precise scale is used.  To avoid this potentially confusing peculiarity, age in years will be either calculated as (**age** = **year** - **byear**) or as (**ageALT** = **agemon**/12). See "Mime metrics" section of this report for details.

```{r,echo=echoChunks, message=F, error=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width="700px", fig.width = 8 }

ds<- dsL[dsL$id %in% c(4, 25, 35, 47),]
ds$age<-ds$year-ds$byear
p<-ggplot(ds, aes(x=age,y=as.numeric(attend), color=idF ))
p<-p+ geom_line()
# p<-p+ geom_smooth(method=lm)
p<-p+ geom_point()
p<-p+ scale_y_continuous("Church attendance",
                     limits=c(1, 8),
                     breaks=c(1:8))
p<-p+ scale_x_continuous("Age in years",
                   limits=c(16,31),
                   breaks=seq(from=12, to=31,by=1))
p<-p+ labs(title=paste0("In the past year, how often have you attended a worship service?"))
p
```

## Selecting and Augmenting data for modeling
We need only a few variables at any given moment in the process of modeling, so let's select only those we need to describe how respondents' church attendance was changing across time and age. Let's start with picking person's id, wave of measurement, and church attendance
```{r}
print (dsL[dsL$id==1,c("id","year","attend")])
```
Now, let's add to the selection person's year of birth and age in months at the time of the interview
```{r, echo=TRUE}
selectCols<-c("year","id","byear","agemon","attend") # type in variable name
ds<-dsL[,selectCols] # select all rows and only columns listed in the object selectCols
print(ds[ds$id==1,])  # print all availible data for respondent with ID number of 1
```
Generally we can select any desired dataset by formula **dataset**[  _condition for rows_  ,  _condition for columns_  ]
```{r}
ds<-dsL[dsL$year %in% c(2000:2011),c('id',"byear","year","attendF","ageyearF","agemon")]
print(ds[ds$id==1,]) 
```
