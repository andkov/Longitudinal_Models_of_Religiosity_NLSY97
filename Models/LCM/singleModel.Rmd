# Model specification   
The model is of the class

# Sequence specification

# Model and Data specification

# Model results

# Basic elements of the S4 object

The full model summary can be accessed by command:
```{r }
summary(model) 
```

After studying 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
str(summary(model)$vcov@x)
str(summary(model)$varcor)
```
we can spot a few complex elements that would be particularly useful

str(summary(model)$varcor)


## Model formula
```{r }
model@call 
```

## Fit and Information indices

```{r mInfo}

```

## Random Effects (RE)

### Matrix of RE
```{r mRE}
# extract RE covariance matrix

```

### extracting RE for each individual
```{r RE}

```

## Fixed Effects (FE)


### estimate of the FE
```{r FE}
# similar ways to extract FE estimates, #3 is the fullest

```

### Matrix of FE
```{r mFE}

```


## Model output
```{r dsp_recover_input}
# Read back when went into the model

```

### Prediction and Residuals

```{r dsp_yHat_resid}

```

## Conditional values
The fixed effects  collectivelly define a trajectory that summarises differences among individuals. Uusing the values of the estimated parameters, we reconstruct the trjecectory from which the individual trajectories vary, according to the estimated random effects, if present in the model.

The columns named as fixed effect coefficients (gamma00:gammaKP), contain  predicted trajectories of the outcome (y), computed using only the correspodning term (gamma coefficient x predictor(s), if present). Thus, collumn *gamma00* contains the predicted trajectory of church attendance cumputed using only the grand mean (gamma00) of the current model specification. 

```{r}
cat("\014")
head(dsp)
dsp$gamma00<- ifelse( is.na(FE["(Intercept)"]),0,FE["(Intercept)"])
head(dsp)
```

The effects that were not present in the model will be substituted with zeros. 
```{r predictFE}

```

Of particular interest is variable **yFE** which has several interpretations. It is:      
  0. the sum of all estimated fixed effects (gamma00:gammaKP) in (person x timepoint) cell    
  1. the overall model solution for the interindividual  differences   
  2. the average intraindividual pattern     
  3. the prediction of the model with interindividual variability factored out, as opposed to **yHat**, generated using both fixed and random effect(s) coefficients.  

The deviations from this average trajectory will be recorded in **RE**, containing a column for each of the random effects estimated.  

```{r predictRE}

```

```{r indDisturb}
