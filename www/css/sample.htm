<h3>Complexity on the rise</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=FirstWordChar>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Quantitative</span> methodology offers a certain kind of active and interesting
challenge. <span class=FirstWordChar>In the</span> last 50 years, the variety
and amount of data being collected on human-related activity have been
accelerating. <span class=FirstWordChar>Technology</span> has made it easier to
collect, process, and share data. <span class=FirstWordChar>A remarkable</span>
variety of methodological approaches has been developed to accommodate new
types and amounts of data. <span class=FirstWordChar>Some</span> of those
approaches are models, which have become numerous, specialized, and
complicated. <span class=FirstWordChar>Consequently</span>, human limitations
in attention, perception, and information processing have become relevant in
working with models. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=FirstWordChar>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Contributing</span> to the challenge is the particular difficulty associated
with the measurement of the primary subject matter of social science, behavior.
<span class=FirstWordChar>A number</span> of years ago, in a discussion
concerning the role of methodology in the future of psychology, Raymond Cattell
(1988, p. 5) noted that “[in order]<span class=directquoteChar><span
style='font-style:normal'> to overcome the difficulties due to unusually
complex subject matter, it is now necessary for psychologists to become
unusually explicit and sophisticated about methodology</span></span>.” <span
class=FirstWordChar>Indeed</span>, since then psychologists have become
substantially more sophisticated with their methodology than they were in 1988,
to the degree that in some (perhaps many) cases it is now prohibitive, if not
impossible, for non-experts to appreciate, much less to employ, the
methodological fruits of their labors.&nbsp; </p>
