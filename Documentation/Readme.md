# Documentation Directory

In this directory, include documentation about the datasets, such as codebooks.  Make sure the documentation doesn't include passwords, PHI, or anything else that should remain private.  Even if the repository is private, we do NOT treat GitHub as HIPAA compliant (this is just our instinct, and not the official advice from any lawyer).
